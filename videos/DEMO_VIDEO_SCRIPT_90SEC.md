# 90-Second Demo Video Script

## SCBE-AETHERMOORE: AI Governance Through Geometry

---

### [0:00-0:10] Hook

**VISUAL:** Dramatic zoom into a 3D Poincaré ball with glowing agents

**NARRATION:**
"What if AI safety wasn't about rules that could be broken... but geometry that couldn't?"

---

### [0:10-0:25] The Problem

**VISUAL:** Split screen - left shows AI making risky decisions, right shows blocked prompts being bypassed

**NARRATION:**
"AI agents are making high-stakes decisions every second. Traditional safety says 'don't do that.' But rules get bypassed. Jailbreaks happen. We needed something different."

---

### [0:25-0:45] The Solution

**VISUAL:** Animated Poincaré ball forming, agents appearing at positions

**NARRATION:**
"Meet SCBE-AETHERMOORE. We map AI actions into hyperbolic space. Safe actions live in the center. Dangerous actions are pushed to the edge. And the edge? It's infinitely far away."

**VISUAL:** Show exponential curve H(d) = exp(d²)

**NARRATION:**
"The Harmonic Wall makes adversarial actions cost exponentially more. At some point, they become impossible. Not forbidden. Impossible."

---

### [0:45-1:05] The Demo

**VISUAL:** Live Streamlit dashboard

**NARRATION:**
"Six specialized agents work together in a swarm. Each has a role. Four of six must agree on any action."

**VISUAL:** Show governance API call

**NARRATION:**
"Every AI decision goes through our /govern API. ALLOW. ESCALATE. DENY. In under a millisecond."

**VISUAL:** Show risk score and harmonic cost

---

### [1:05-1:20] The Result

**VISUAL:** Side-by-side: traditional AI (red warnings) vs SCBE (green checkmarks)

**NARRATION:**
"995 tests passing. Post-quantum cryptography. Patent pending. And completely open source."

---

### [1:20-1:30] Call to Action

**VISUAL:** GitHub repo, Streamlit demo link

**NARRATION:**
"Try the demo. Star the repo. Join us in making AI that's safe by design, not by policy."

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**
```
github.com/issdandavis/SCBE-AETHERMOORE
"We don't write rules. We write geometry."
```
