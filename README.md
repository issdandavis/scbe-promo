## What is SCBE-AETHERMOORE?

**The navigation system for AI agents** - the same math that coordinates drone swarms now coordinates coding agents, preventing drift into bugs, hallucinations, or policy violations.

### The Problem
AI agents are **blind**. They can't see the full codebase, what other agents are doing, or when they're drifting from intended behavior.

### The Solution
A **geometric containment framework** where dangerous AI thoughts are not just forbidden - they are **mathematically impossible**.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Poincare Ball** | Hyperbolic space where boundary = infinite cost |
| **Harmonic Wall** | H(d) = exp(d²) - exponential penalty for adversarial actions |
| **Six Sacred Tongues** | KO/AV/RU/CA/UM/DR agent specializations |
| **BFT Consensus** | 4-of-6 agents must agree (tolerates 2 failures) |
| **Decimal Drift** | Pythagorean comma (1.0136) for non-repeating keys |

---

## Use Cases

1. **AI Coding Swarms** - 6 agents collaborate with geometric safety
2. **Space Debris Removal** - Autonomous spacecraft coordination
3. **Enterprise AI Governance** - Every AI action passes through /govern API
4. **Medical Nanobot Swarms** - Safe autonomous operation
