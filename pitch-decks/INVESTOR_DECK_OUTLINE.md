## Slide 2: The Problem

**AI agents are making high-stakes decisions without guardrails**

- $2.3B lost to AI errors in 2025
- 67% of enterprises have no AI governance policy
- Jailbreaks bypass 94% of rule-based safety systems

*"The AI should not do X" is not good enough.*

---

## Slide 3: Our Solution

**Geometric Containment for AI**

Instead of rules that can be bypassed, we use mathematics that can't.

```
Traditional: if (action == "dangerous") { block(); }
SCBE:        cost = exp(distance²)  // Impossible at boundary
```

---

## Slide 4: How It Works

**The Poincaré Ball Model**

[Diagram: 3D ball with agents, center=safe, edge=dangerous]

- AI actions mapped to positions in hyperbolic space
- Distance from center = risk level
- Boundary = infinite cost (impossible to reach)

## Slide 5: The Technology

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| Harmonic Wall | exp(d²) cost function |
| 6-Agent Swarm | BFT consensus (4/6) |
| Sacred Tongues | Specialized agent roles |
| PQC Crypto | Kyber + Dilithium |

**995+ tests passing. Patent pending.**

## Slide 6: Product

**/govern API**

```json
POST /v1/govern
{
  "actor": {"type": "ai"},
  "resource": {"value_usd": 50000},
  "intent": "auto_approve"
}

→ {"decision": "ESCALATE", "risk_score": 0.73}
```

Sub-millisecond latency. Full audit trail.

## Slide 7: Market

**$4.2B AI Governance Market by 2028**

- 40% CAGR
- Every enterprise deploying AI agents needs governance
- Regulatory pressure increasing (EU AI Act, etc.)

---

## Slide 8: Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Approach | Weakness |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Constitutional AI | Self-critique loops | Can loop forever |
| RLHF | Human feedback | Expensive, slow |
| Rule-based | If-then statements | Easy to bypass |
| **SCBE** | **Geometric invariants** | **Math can't be hacked** |
