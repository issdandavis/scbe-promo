## SCBE-AETHERMOORE Launches Open-Source AI Governance Framework Using Hyperbolic Geometry

*New approach makes dangerous AI actions "mathematically impossible" rather than just forbidden*

**[City, State] - January 30, 2026** - Today marks the public release of SCBE-AETHERMOORE, an open-source AI governance framework that uses hyperbolic geometry to create safety guarantees for AI agents. Unlike traditional rule-based approaches that can be bypassed through prompt injection or jailbreaks, SCBE-AETHERMOORE makes dangerous actions mathematically impossible by leveraging the same geometric principles used in spacetime physics.

### The Problem with Current AI Safety

"Current AI safety relies on telling AI what not to do," said Issac Davis, creator of SCBE-AETHERMOORE. "But rules can be bypassed. Our approach is different - we make dangerous actions cost infinitely more than beneficial ones. The geometry itself enforces safety."

### How It Works

SCBE-AETHERMOORE maps AI actions into a Poincaré ball, a model of hyperbolic space where:
- The center represents safe operations
- The boundary represents dangerous actions
- Distance to the boundary is infinite (impossible to reach)

The framework's "Harmonic Wall" function, H(d) = exp(d²), creates an exponential cost barrier. As an AI agent drifts from intended behavior, the computational cost increases exponentially until adversarial actions become infeasible.

### Key Features

- **6-Agent Swarm Architecture**: Specialized agents (KO, AV, RU, CA, UM, DR) provide Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Integrated ML-KEM (Kyber) and ML-DSA (Dilithium) for future-proof security
- **Governance API**: RESTful /govern endpoint for real-time AI action validation
- **995+ Tests Passing**: Comprehensive test coverage including formal verification

### Applications

The framework is designed for:
- Enterprise AI governance
- Multi-agent coding systems ("Swarm Coder")
- Autonomous spacecraft coordination
- Any scenario requiring provable AI safety guarantees
