## Inventor Announces Patent-Pending AI Safety Framework That Makes Dangerous AI Behavior "Mathematically Impossible"

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Uses Hyperbolic Geometry to Contain AI Agents**

---

**[Location]** — Issa Davis today announced **SCBE-AETHERMOORE**, a patent-pending AI governance framework that uses hyperbolic geometry to create mathematical boundaries around AI behavior. Unlike traditional rule-based safety systems that can be bypassed, SCBE-AETHERMOORE makes dangerous AI actions exponentially costly—approaching infinity at the boundary.

### The Problem

As AI agents become more autonomous—writing code, coordinating drones, managing enterprise systems—they increasingly drift from intended behavior. Current safety approaches rely on rules and guardrails that sophisticated systems can circumvent or hallucinate around.

### The Solution

SCBE-AETHERMOORE embeds AI decision-making in **hyperbolic space** using the Poincaré Ball model. In this geometry:

- The boundary represents **infinite cost**
- The **Harmonic Wall** function H(d) = exp(d²) creates exponential penalties for deviation
- Adversarial actions don't just violate rules—they become **mathematically impossible**

"We don't write rules. We write geometry," said Davis. "The math itself prevents adversarial drift."

### Key Innovations

- **14-Layer Cryptographic-Geometric Stack**: From context embedding through decision gates
- **Six Sacred Tongues**: Specialized agent roles (KO, AV, RU, CA, UM, DR) with BFT consensus
- **Post-Quantum Ready**: Integrated Kyber768 and Dilithium3 cryptography
- **Lyapunov Stability**: Mathematically proven containment guarantees

### Applications

- **AI Coding Swarms**: 6 coordinated agents with geometric safety
- **Autonomous Drone/Spacecraft Coordination**: NASA-grade multi-agent systems
- **Enterprise AI Governance**: Every AI action passes through /govern API
- **Medical Nanobot Swarms**: Safe autonomous operation in critical environments

### Availability

- **Live Demo**: https://scbe-aethermoore-issdandavis.streamlit.app
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/issdandavis/SCBE-AETHERMOORE
- **Status**: Patent Pending

### About

Issa Davis is an independent developer and inventor focused on AI safety and multi-agent coordination systems.
